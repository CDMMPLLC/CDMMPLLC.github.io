  <h3>HISTORY</h3>
  <p>Masters Publishing LLC was founded by Colton J. Masters in 2017.  We value education, self growth
      and imagination, which is why the books that are published include life lessons or serve to provide
      others with a connection to the world around us. </p><br>

  <h3>A MESSAGE FROM THE FOUNDER</h3>
  <p>"As a child, books helped to provide an escape from reality. I would often find myself pouring through
      the pages of any book I could get my hands on. The amazing stories about far off adventures and the
      brave characters who always seemed to prevail, helped me become the person I am today.</p>

  <p>As I reflect on my life, it is clear that the many days I spent with my nose in a book, and the
    countless stories I read have helped direct the paths I chose in life. I firmly believe I owe much of
    my success to the dozens of authors who helped shape my view of the world and helped me find my place
    in it.</p>

  <p>Even at a young age, I found myself trying to explain the many facets of the world around me through
    writing. As I grew, I worked hard to develop my stories and with the encouragement from those around
    me, I created Masters Publishing to release those stories to you.</p>

  <p>We were established on the idea that books can not only help children grow and learn, but can help
    them discover their passion in life. That is why we work so diligently to ensure that we put out the
    best possible books for your enjoyment.</p>

  <p>Whether on the sunny shores of an ocean beach or a secret cave high in the mountains. We strive to
    bring unique ideas and worlds to life, between the pages of each book."</p>
